- whenever u make any changes to the codebase especially the code related files
  you will have to ensure you have written new test cases ( unit, integration,
  end to end) which ever makes sense sometimes it can be a combination or
  sometimes its just individual.

- Once u have concluded with writing the code apart from writing relavant test
  cases, you should also test them up thoroughly to ensure that u have not
  broken any code with your new code also that your code has no bugs.

- dont commit or push your changes until and unless u are asked to do so.
- i want u to report to me once u have throrougly verified your fix is working.
  Dont report to me until an d unless u are 100% confident of what u have
  implemented. Mostly backed up by your testing especially end to end testing
  whenever possible
- while starting frontend use Bash(fesh) and for starting websocket Bash(adwsh)
  this should start our backend and frontend scripts that we have written.
