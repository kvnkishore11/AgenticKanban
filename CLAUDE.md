- whenever u make any changes to the codebase especially the code related files
  you will have to ensure you have written new test cases ( unit, integration,
  end to end) which ever makes sense sometimes it can be a combination or
  sometimes its just individual.

- Once u have concluded with writing the code apart from writing relavant test
  cases, you should also test them up thoroughly to ensure that u have not
  broken any code with your new code also that your code has no bugs.

- dont commit or push your changes until and unless u are asked to do so.
