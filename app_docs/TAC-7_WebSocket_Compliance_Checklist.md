# TAC-7 WebSocket Integration Compliance Checklist

## Audit Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** Complete
**Existing Implementation Quality:** Good foundation with several compliance gaps identified

## Current Implementation Strengths ✅

### Connection Management
- ✅ **Basic connection retry logic** with exponential backoff (1s → 30s)
- ✅ **Auto-reconnect mechanism** when connection drops unexpectedly
- ✅ **Connection state tracking** (isConnected, isConnecting)
- ✅ **WebSocket URL configuration** with protocol, host, port
- ✅ **Graceful disconnection** with proper close codes

### Message Handling
- ✅ **Event-driven architecture** with listener management
- ✅ **Message parsing** with error handling for invalid JSON
- ✅ **Basic message types** supported: trigger_response, status_update, error, pong
- ✅ **Workflow triggering** via WebSocket with task context
- ✅ **Status update handling** for workflow progress

### UI Integration
- ✅ **Connection status display** in kanban cards
- ✅ **Workflow triggering buttons** in card interface
- ✅ **Real-time workflow status** updates in UI
- ✅ **WebSocket status indicators** (connected/disconnected/connecting)
- ✅ **Manual workflow triggering** from kanban interface

### Health Monitoring
- ✅ **Basic heartbeat mechanism** (ping/pong every 30s)
- ✅ **Health check endpoint** support (/health)
- ✅ **Connection quality tracking** (reconnect attempts)

## Identified Compliance Gaps ⚠️

### 1. Connection Management Enhancements
- ❌ **Connection timeout handling** for workflow responses
  - Current: No timeout for workflow operations
  - Required: Implement timeout with configurable duration
  - Impact: Can cause hanging operations

- ❌ **Connection state persistence** across browser sessions
  - Current: State lost on page refresh
  - Required: Persist connection config and auto-reconnect
  - Impact: Poor user experience on page reload

- ❌ **Enhanced retry logic** configuration
  - Current: Fixed retry parameters
  - Required: Configurable retry strategies per workflow type
  - Impact: Not optimized for different workflow complexities

### 2. Message Protocol Compliance
- ❌ **Comprehensive message validation** according to TAC-7 specs
  - Current: Basic JSON parsing with minimal validation
  - Required: Schema-based validation for all message types
  - Impact: Invalid messages can cause silent failures

- ❌ **Additional message types** from TAC-7 guide
  - Current: Limited to basic workflow messages
  - Required: Support for all TAC-7 message types
  - Impact: Limited integration capabilities

- ❌ **Message queuing** for offline scenarios
  - Current: Messages lost if not connected
  - Required: Queue messages when offline, send when reconnected
  - Impact: Reliability issues during connection problems

### 3. Security and Performance
- ❌ **Security measures** implementation
  - Current: No authentication or authorization
  - Required: Implement TAC-7 security recommendations
  - Impact: Security vulnerabilities

- ❌ **Performance monitoring** and metrics
  - Current: Basic connection state only
  - Required: Comprehensive performance metrics
  - Impact: No visibility into performance issues

- ❌ **Request rate limiting** and queue management
  - Current: No rate limiting
  - Required: Prevent overwhelming the server
  - Impact: Potential service disruption

### 4. Error Handling Enhancement
- ❌ **User-friendly error mapping**
  - Current: Technical error messages exposed to users
  - Required: User-friendly error messages with suggestions
  - Impact: Poor user experience during errors

- ❌ **Enhanced error recovery** mechanisms
  - Current: Basic reconnection only
  - Required: Sophisticated error recovery strategies
  - Impact: Poor resilience to various failure scenarios

- ❌ **Graceful degradation** when WebSocket unavailable
  - Current: Hard failure when WebSocket down
  - Required: Fallback mechanisms or alternative flows
  - Impact: System unusable during WebSocket outages

### 5. Health Monitoring Enhancement
- ❌ **Enhanced health monitoring** service
  - Current: Basic ping/pong
  - Required: Comprehensive health diagnostics
  - Impact: Limited troubleshooting capabilities

- ❌ **Automated health checks** with alerting
  - Current: No automated monitoring
  - Required: Background health monitoring with notifications
  - Impact: Issues not detected proactively

- ❌ **Connection quality monitoring**
  - Current: Basic connection state
  - Required: Latency, throughput, reliability metrics
  - Impact: No insight into connection quality issues

### 6. UI Integration Improvements
- ❌ **WebSocket status indicator component**
  - Current: Status shown only in cards
  - Required: Dedicated status indicator component
  - Impact: Status not visible in all contexts

- ❌ **Real-time progress indicators** for workflow execution
  - Current: Basic progress updates
  - Required: Detailed step-by-step progress visualization
  - Impact: Limited visibility into workflow execution

- ❌ **Drag-and-drop workflow triggering**
  - Current: Manual button triggering only
  - Required: Trigger workflows on kanban drag-and-drop actions
  - Impact: Less intuitive workflow initiation

### 7. Testing Infrastructure
- ❌ **Comprehensive E2E tests** for WebSocket integration
  - Current: No automated tests
  - Required: Full end-to-end test suite
  - Impact: No automated validation of functionality

- ❌ **Unit tests** for WebSocket compliance features
  - Current: No unit tests for WebSocket code
  - Required: Comprehensive unit test coverage
  - Impact: No protection against regressions

- ❌ **Integration tests** for kanban workflow triggering
  - Current: Manual testing only
  - Required: Automated integration testing
  - Impact: Integration issues not caught automatically

- ❌ **Stress tests** for connection reliability
  - Current: No load testing
  - Required: Test under various load conditions
  - Impact: Unknown behavior under stress
