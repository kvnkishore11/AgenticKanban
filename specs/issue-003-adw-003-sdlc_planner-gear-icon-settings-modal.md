# Bug: Gear Icon Missing Settings Modal Functionality

## Metadata
issue_number: `003`
adw_id: `003`
issue_json: `{"title": "Gear Icon Settings Access", "body": "i was talking about having those settings at the gear icon here [Image #1]. i am not able to see those changes u have made.. could you ensure that you have built the logic for this gear icon."}`

## Bug Description
The gear/settings icon in the main navigation header has no functionality. Users expect to access project notification settings and other application-level settings through this gear icon, but clicking it currently does nothing. The icon exists in the UI but lacks the necessary click handler and settings modal implementation.

## Problem Statement
The settings gear icon in the main navigation (App.jsx) is non-functional - it has no onClick handler and no associated settings modal or panel. Users cannot access notification settings or other application configurations through this expected entry point.

## Solution Statement
Implement a complete settings modal system triggered by the gear icon, including a settings modal component that provides access to project notification configurations and other application-level settings.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the AgenticKanban application
2. Look for the gear/settings icon in the top navigation header
3. Click the gear icon
4. Observe that nothing happens - no modal opens, no settings panel appears
5. Notice there's no way to access notification settings through this expected UI element

## Root Cause Analysis
The gear icon button in App.jsx (lines 78-80) is rendered as a static button with no onClick handler:
```jsx
<button className="p-2 text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-600">
  <Settings className="h-5 w-5" />
</button>
```

The component is missing:
- Click event handler
- State management for modal visibility
- Settings modal component
- Integration with notification settings functionality

## Relevant Files
Use these files to fix the bug:

- `src/App.jsx` - Contains the gear icon button that needs click handler and modal state management
- `src/components/ProjectPortConfiguration.jsx` - Contains notification settings functionality that should be accessible in the settings modal
- `src/stores/kanbanStore.js` - Contains notification-related state management that may need to be exposed in settings

### New Files
- `src/components/SettingsModal.jsx` - New modal component to house application settings including notification configurations

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

### Task 1: Create Settings Modal Component
- Create `src/components/SettingsModal.jsx` component with modal structure
- Include tabs or sections for different settings categories (e.g., "Project Notifications", "General")
- Add proper modal styling with backdrop, close functionality, and responsive design
- Include ProjectPortConfiguration component for notification settings
- Add close button and ESC key handling

### Task 2: Add Modal State Management to App.jsx
- Add state for settings modal visibility (`showSettingsModal`)
- Add toggle function for opening/closing the settings modal
- Import the new SettingsModal component

### Task 3: Connect Gear Icon to Settings Modal
- Add onClick handler to the gear icon button in App.jsx
- Connect the click handler to open the settings modal
- Ensure proper hover states and accessibility attributes

### Task 4: Integrate Notification Settings
- Pass necessary props to SettingsModal for accessing project notification configurations
- Ensure settings changes are properly saved and reflected in the application
- Test that notification settings work correctly when accessed through the gear icon

### Task 5: Create E2E Test for Settings Modal
- Read `.claude/commands/e2e/test_basic_query.md` and create a new E2E test file in `.claude/commands/e2e/test_gear_icon_settings_modal.md` that validates:
  - Gear icon is clickable and opens settings modal
  - Settings modal contains notification configuration options
  - Settings can be modified and saved successfully
  - Modal can be closed via close button and ESC key
  - Settings persist after closing and reopening the modal

### Task 6: Run Validation Commands
- Execute all validation commands to ensure the bug is fixed with zero regressions

## Validation Commands
Execute every command to validate the bug is fixed with zero regressions.

- Read `.claude/commands/test_e2e.md`, then read and execute your new E2E `.claude/commands/e2e/test_gear_icon_settings_modal.md` test file to validate this functionality works
- `npm run lint` - Run linting to validate code quality standards
- `npm run build` - Run frontend build to validate the bug is fixed with zero regressions
- `npm run test` - Run frontend tests to validate the bug is fixed with zero regressions
- Manual test: Click gear icon to verify settings modal opens
- Manual test: Verify notification settings are accessible and functional within the modal
- Manual test: Verify modal can be closed properly
- Manual test: Verify settings persist correctly

## Notes
- The settings modal should be designed to accommodate future settings additions beyond just notification configurations
- Ensure the modal follows the existing design system and styling patterns used in other modals (like TaskInput)
- Consider accessibility best practices including focus management and keyboard navigation
- The modal should be responsive and work well on different screen sizes
