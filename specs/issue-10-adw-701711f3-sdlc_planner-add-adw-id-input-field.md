## Chore Description
Add an optional ADW ID input field to the task creation form to allow users to specify a custom ADW ID instead of using the auto-generated one. This is needed because some ADW scripts require a specific ADW ID as input parameter. Currently, ADW IDs are automatically generated by the `adwCreationService.generateAdwId()` function, but users should have the option to provide their own ADW ID when needed.

The task creation form in `TaskInput.jsx` needs to be enhanced with:
- An optional text input field for custom ADW ID
- Validation to ensure ADW ID follows proper format if provided
- Integration with the existing task creation flow to use custom ADW ID when provided
- Fallback to auto-generated ADW ID when no custom ID is provided

## Relevant Files
Use these files to resolve the chore:

- `src/components/forms/TaskInput.jsx` - Main task creation form component that needs the new ADW ID input field
- `src/stores/kanbanStore.js` - Contains the `createTask` function that needs to handle custom ADW ID parameter
- `src/services/adwCreationService.js` - Contains ADW creation logic and `generateAdwId()` function that needs to support custom ADW ID override
- `adws/adw_plan_iso.py` - Example ADW script showing how adw_id parameter is used: `uv run adw_plan_iso.py <issue-number> [adw-id]`

### New Files
No new files need to be created for this chore.

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

### Step 1: Update TaskInput Component
- Add a new optional text input field for ADW ID in the TaskInput form
- Position the field appropriately in the form layout (after work item type selection)
- Add proper label, placeholder text, and help text explaining the field's purpose
- Implement local state management for the ADW ID input value
- Add basic validation to ensure ADW ID format is valid if provided (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores)
- Include the ADW ID value in the taskData object passed to createTask

### Step 2: Update ADW Creation Service
- Modify the `createAdwConfiguration` method in `adwCreationService.js` to accept an optional custom ADW ID parameter
- Update the `generateAdwId` method to return the custom ADW ID if provided, otherwise generate one automatically
- Ensure the custom ADW ID is properly validated and formatted
- Update any related configuration structures to use the custom or generated ADW ID

### Step 3: Update Kanban Store
- Modify the `createTask` function in `kanbanStore.js` to pass the custom ADW ID (if provided) to the ADW creation service
- Ensure the task creation flow properly handles both custom and auto-generated ADW IDs
- Update any task metadata to include information about whether a custom ADW ID was used

### Step 4: Add Input Validation
- Implement proper validation for the ADW ID input field to ensure it meets format requirements
- Add error handling and user feedback for invalid ADW ID formats
- Ensure the validation integrates with the existing form validation system in TaskInput

### Step 5: Test Integration
- Verify that tasks can be created with custom ADW IDs
- Verify that tasks can still be created without specifying an ADW ID (using auto-generated ones)
- Test that the ADW ID is properly passed through the entire task creation flow
- Ensure the custom ADW ID appears correctly in task metadata and logs

## Validation Commands
Execute every command to validate the chore is complete with zero regressions.

- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to ensure code style and quality standards are met
- `npm run build` - Build the application to ensure no compilation errors
- `npm run test` - Run component tests to validate TaskInput form functionality
- `npm run dev` - Start the development server to manually test the new ADW ID input field
- Create a test task with a custom ADW ID through the UI to verify end-to-end functionality
- Create a test task without specifying an ADW ID to verify auto-generation still works

## Notes
- The ADW ID should be optional - users can leave it blank to use auto-generated IDs
- ADW ID format should support alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores
- Consider adding a tooltip or help text explaining when users might want to specify a custom ADW ID
- Ensure the implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing task creation flows
- The custom ADW ID should be validated to prevent conflicts with existing ADW instances
