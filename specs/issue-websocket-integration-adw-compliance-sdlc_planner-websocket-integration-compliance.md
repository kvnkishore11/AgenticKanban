# Feature: WebSocket Integration Compliance Enhancement

## Metadata
issue_number: `websocket-integration`
adw_id: `compliance`
issue_json: `{"title": "WebSocket Integration Compliance Enhancement", "body": "Ensure the kanban board fully complies with TAC-7 WebSocket Integration Guide requirements to prevent integration issues when creating tickets"}`

## Feature Description
Enhance the existing WebSocket integration in the Agentic Kanban board to ensure full compliance with the TAC-7 WebSocket Integration Guide. This feature addresses gaps in the current implementation to prevent integration issues, improve reliability, and ensure all recommended practices are followed for seamless communication with the TAC-7 WebSocket Trigger Service.

## User Story
As a developer using the Agentic Kanban board
I want the WebSocket integration to fully comply with TAC-7 integration standards
So that I can reliably trigger AI workflows without encountering integration issues or communication failures

## Problem Statement
While the kanban board has an existing WebSocket service implementation, there are potential gaps and missing features compared to the comprehensive TAC-7 WebSocket Integration Guide. These gaps could lead to communication failures, unreliable workflow triggering, poor error handling, and user experience issues when integrating with client projects.

## Solution Statement
Implement a comprehensive audit and enhancement of the existing WebSocket integration to ensure 100% compliance with the TAC-7 integration guide. This includes adding missing features, improving error handling, enhancing user feedback mechanisms, implementing proper security measures, and providing comprehensive testing to validate the integration works reliably in all scenarios.

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Foundation
Audit the existing WebSocket implementation against the TAC-7 integration guide to identify all gaps and create a comprehensive compliance checklist. Establish testing infrastructure and monitoring tools.

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
Implement missing features, enhance error handling, add user feedback mechanisms, and integrate compliance improvements into the existing kanban board workflow.

### Phase 3: Integration
Complete the integration with comprehensive testing, UI enhancements, and validation to ensure the system works reliably in all scenarios specified in the integration guide.

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

### Audit and Analysis
- Conduct comprehensive audit of existing WebSocket service against TAC-7 integration guide requirements

- Implement connection timeout handling for workflow responses
- Add connection state persistence across browser sessions
- Enhance heartbeat mechanism to match guide specifications exactly

### Message Protocol Compliance
- Verify all message types from integration guide are properly supported
- Implement proper message validation according to guide specifications
- Add support for all workflow types listed in the integration guide
- Enhance error message handling with user-friendly error mapping

### UI Integration Improvements
- Create WebSocket connection status indicator component for user feedback
- Integrate workflow triggering with kanban board drag-and-drop actions
- Add real-time progress indicators for workflow execution
- Implement user notifications for connection status changes

### Security and Performance
- Implement security measures recommended in the integration guide
- Add performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Implement proper cleanup mechanisms for memory management
- Add request rate limiting and queue management

### Error Handling Enhancement
- Implement comprehensive error mapping utility for user-friendly messages
- Add proper error recovery mechanisms for different failure scenarios
- Enhance logging for debugging and monitoring purposes
- Implement graceful degradation when WebSocket service is unavailable

### Health Monitoring
- Create enhanced health monitoring service with detailed diagnostics
- Implement automated health checks with proper alerting
- Add connection quality monitoring and reporting
- Create dashboard for monitoring WebSocket service health

### Testing Infrastructure
- Create comprehensive E2E test file for WebSocket integration validation
- Implement unit tests for all new WebSocket compliance features
- Add integration tests for kanban board workflow triggering scenarios
- Create stress tests for connection reliability under various conditions

### Documentation and Validation
- Update code documentation to reflect compliance changes
- Create integration troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Validate all changes against TAC-7 integration guide requirements
- Run comprehensive validation commands to ensure zero regressions

## Testing Strategy
### Unit Tests
- Test WebSocket service compliance with all TAC-7 message formats
- Test error handling for all error types specified in integration guide
- Test connection management with various network conditions
- Test workflow triggering with different task types and configurations

### Edge Cases
- Connection failures during workflow execution
- WebSocket server restart scenarios
- Multiple concurrent workflow triggers
- Network timeout and recovery scenarios
- Invalid message format handling
- Server health check failures

## Acceptance Criteria
- All WebSocket message types from TAC-7 guide are supported and tested
- Connection management follows exact specifications from integration guide
- Error handling provides user-friendly messages for all error types
- UI provides clear feedback on WebSocket connection status
- Workflow triggering works reliably from kanban board actions
- Health monitoring provides comprehensive diagnostics
- E2E tests validate all integration scenarios work correctly
- Performance meets or exceeds recommendations from integration guide
- Security measures are implemented as specified in guide
- Documentation is complete and accurate for troubleshooting

## Validation Commands
Execute every command to validate the feature works correctly with zero regressions.

- `cd app/server && uv run pytest` - Run server tests to validate the feature works with zero regressions
- `cd app/client && bun tsc --noEmit` - Run frontend tests to validate the feature works with zero regressions
- `cd app/client && bun run build` - Run frontend build to validate the feature works with zero regressions
- Read `.claude/commands/test_e2e.md`, then read and execute your new E2E `.claude/commands/e2e/test_websocket_integration.md` test file to validate this functionality works
- Manual testing of WebSocket connection scenarios including server restart and network failures
- Validation that all TAC-7 integration guide examples work correctly with the enhanced implementation

- Security validation of all implemented measures

## Notes
- The TAC-7 WebSocket Integration Guide provides comprehensive specifications that must be followed exactly
- Existing implementation already has good foundation but needs compliance verification and enhancements
- Focus on reliability and user experience - integration failures should be clearly communicated to users
- Performance considerations include supporting up to 15 concurrent workflows as specified in guide
- Security measures should be implemented even though current guide mentions unauthenticated connections
- Consider future scalability and production deployment requirements
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing kanban board functionality
